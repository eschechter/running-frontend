This webpage allows a user to generate runs by creating points on a map, and to share these runs with friends. It uses React and Redux for its frontend. 

To use the app, please clone this repo and https://github.com/eschechter/running-backend. Then, follow the directions in the README for the backend directory to migrate the database and start the server. 

Next, in the frontend directory, run

### `npm install` 
### `npm start`

to install  packages and start the app in development mode. 

Lastly, for a deployed version of the app, please see https://running-mate.herokuapp.com.
